# EG-desktop-for-Android
An android version of the PC application that emulates both 32 &amp; 64 bit PC applications. It does not have the Quemu emulation shell built in. It has its own emulation shell made from scratch. You run an EXE file, and it will run it. Keep up with all of the new updates that are going to be coming out every 2, or more weeks. Have fun!!!😝😝😝😝😝😝- Extra Gunz
